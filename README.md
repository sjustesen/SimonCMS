# PHPbraco

(relax, it's just a working title... ;-) ... And nothing to see here, just getting started)
This is not a clone, merely it is a loveletter. And it is *not* afiliated with Umbraco project.

## Storytime
I've been away from the PHP platform for quite some years. I have been using this wonderful Content Management System called Umbraco on the Microsoft.NET platform. Having utilized other CMS' on the PHP from time to time, I know they lack the flexibility of Umbraco.

Like setting up pages and adding more backend controls to a doctype is just a breeze. I am not aware of any CMS' on the PHP platform, that does this to the same extent as Umbraco.Rather than adapting to the workflow of the user, most PHP CMS' gives you a default set of backend controls, and then the user has to learn every setting. In Umbraco, you more or less start with ... Nothing.. And while that sounds daunting, it puts the user in focus, and makes the learning curve less steep.

Now, PHPbraco is not going to be a 1:1 copy. While I am certainly going to borrow some concepts to a large extent, we're going to cut corners. We don't have the Razor templating system and the same caching system, so we'll need to find substitutes. PHPbraco is built on the Lumen platform, which is a microframework based on Laravel. Therefore we have concepts like Blade (templating system), migrations and routing right out of the box.

## When...
I am notoriously known for not completing projects (because I have a lot of ideas, and bounce back and fourth between them), however I have thought about starting a project like this for years. And I got plenty of time, like years.. I feel like I need to try to make a dent in the history of the internet. I spend quite a lot of time here, so why not do something meaningful? But I really don't know when we'll have something useful to see/try.

Can't wait to get started :)
