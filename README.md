# PHPbraco

(It's just a working title... ;-) ... And nothing to see here, just getting started)
This is not a clone, merely it is a loveletter to the Umbraco. And it is *not* afiliated with Umbraco project.

## Short story
I've been away from the PHP platform for quite some years. I have been using this wonderful Content Management System called Umbraco on the Microsoft.NET platform. Having utilized other CMS' on the PHP from time to time, I see that many contemporary PHP content management systems lack the flexibility found in .NETs Umbraco. Normally, in PHP CMS space, you get a buttload of controls, and you end up using 10% of them.  You, the designer/developer designs the experience. What Umbraco does so brilliantly is that it turns the user experience upside down.  I want to bring that to the PHP platform. So this is why this very repo exists.

## When...
I am notoriously known for not completing projects (because I have a lot of ideas, and bounce back and fourth between them), however I have thought about starting a project like this for years, and having worked on this for a little while, I find that I'm having loads of fun. 
And I got plenty of time, like years.. Not going to make any promises as to when you'll be able to see an alpha version, but perhaps in 1/2 year from now (april 2022).

## Contributions
User contributions are always welcome. I know from other Open Source projects, it can be difficult to know where to step in. But right now everything is up for grabs, so to speak: So send me an email at simon.justesen (at) gmail dot com and let's talk. Right now I'm just setting things up, testing out stuff to know which direction to go. As you can see from my commits I pretty much use git as a timecapsule, making small commits. I'll add some design documents shortly, but the overall idea is just to have fun, while making something that people might find useful.

I got a great feeling about this! Can't wait to get started :)
