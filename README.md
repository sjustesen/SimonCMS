# PHPbraco

(It's just a working title... ;-) ... And nothing to see here, just getting started)
This is not a clone, merely it is a loveletter to the Umbraco. And it is *not* afiliated with Umbraco project.

## Short story
I've been away from the PHP platform for quite some years. I have been using this wonderful Content Management System called Umbraco on the Microsoft.NET platform. 
Having utilized other CMS' on the PHP from time to time, I see that many contemporary PHP content management systems lack the flexibility found in .NETs Umbraco. 
Normally, in PHP CMS space, you get a buttload of controls, and you end up using 10% of them.  You, the designer/developer, should be able to make a tailormade user experience. 
What Umbraco does so brilliantly is that it starts at nothing more or less, and then it's up to you to design the rest. I want to bring that to the PHP platform. 
So this is why this very repo exists.

## When...
Shush, no deadline this is about having fun!

## Contributions
User contributions are always welcome. I know from other Open Source projects, it can be difficult to know where to step in. But right now everything is up for grabs, 
so to speak: So send me an email at simon.justesen (at) gmail dot com and let's talk. Right now I'm just setting things up, testing out stuff to know which direction to go. 

I got a great feeling about this! Can't wait to get started :)
