# PHPbraco

(It's just a working title... ;-) ... And nothing to see here, just getting started)
This is not a clone, merely it is a loveletter to the Umbraco. And it is *not* afiliated with Umbraco project.

## Short story
I've been away from the PHP platform for quite some years. I have been using this wonderful Content Management System called Umbraco on the Microsoft.NET platform. Having utilized other CMS' on the PHP from time to time, I see that many contemporary PHP content management systems lack the flexibility found in .NETs Umbraco.

## When...
I am notoriously known for not completing projects (because I have a lot of ideas, and bounce back and fourth between them), however I have thought about starting a project like this for years, and having worked on this for a little while, I find that I'm having loads of fun. 
And I got plenty of time, like years.. 

## Contributions
User contributions are always welcome. I know from other Open Source projects, it can be difficult to know where to step in. But right now everything is up for grabs, so to speak: So send me an email at simon.justesen (at) gmail dot com and let's talk. Right now I'm just setting things up, testing out stuff to know which direction to go. As you can see from my commits I pretty much use git as a timecapsule, making small commits.

I got a great feeling about this! Can't wait to get started :)
