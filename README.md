# SimonCMS

Welcome to SimonCMS!
What you see here is the beginning of a hopefully brilliant CMS for the PHP platform.
It is, in fact, so new that you really can't do much. Right now, we're in the process of implementing different concepts.
So yeah, not much to see yet. But there will be, eventually!

In lack of a better name, PHPbraco is now SimonCMS. It now has my name, so I better make it good, yes? LOL)

## Short story
I've been away from the PHP platform for quite some years. I have been using and building sites with this wonderful Content Management System (CMS) 
called Umbraco on the Microsoft.NET platform. Having utilized other CMS' on the PHP from time to time, I see that many contemporary PHP content management systems lack the flexibility found in .NETs Umbraco. 
Normally, in PHP CMS space, you get a buttload of controls, and you end up using 10% of them.  You, the designer/developer, should be able to make a tailormade user experience. 
What Umbraco does so brilliantly is that it starts at nothing more or less, and then it's up to you to design the rest through a set of predefined controls. 
I want to bring that to the PHP platform, so here we are! 

This is not a clone, merely it is a loveletter to the Umbraco CMS. It is *not* afiliated with Umbraco project.

## When...
Shush, no deadline - this is about having fun! ;-)
